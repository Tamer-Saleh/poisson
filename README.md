poisson &mdash; Richard Correro
==============================

poisson is a python module for small vessel detection in optical satellite imagery. This module provides a framework for training ship detection models and using them to identify vessels in satellite imagery from [planet](https://www.planet.com/). 

This repository is a work-in-progress. It will eventually contain the module itself, a trained model and its associated files, working notes from the module's creation, and several papers relevant to vessel detection methods.
